Jungalia is Oxiti8 and TIny_Hacker's entry for CC24.

# Description
### By Oxiti8 on [Cemetech](https://cemetech.net)
We've decided on a name: Jungalia. It'll be for the TI-83+/TI-84+, and have shell compatibility.

The concept is a mix of platforming and stealth(subject to change), with a jungle setting.

The story will be intentionally over-the-top for a somewhat comedic effect.

More details coming soon.
